Aletheia (Or Alathea) was the spirit of truth, truthfulness, and sincerity. She had three opposites; Dolos, the god of trickery, Apate, the goddess of deception, and all the Pseudologoi, the gods of lies. Her Roman name was Veritas. She is either a daughter of Zeus or she was created by Prometheus.
